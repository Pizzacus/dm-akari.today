				<h1>Any questions?</h1>
				<div class="question">
					<h3>Wait, will they actually ban me for DMing their bot?</h3>
					<p>
						<div class="discord-message">
							<div class="avatar nao-animate"></div>
							<div class="username nao-color">Nao <span class="time">08/10/2017</span></div>
							<div class="content">If you DM the bot <span class="mention">@Anti-Bully Akari</span> I'm banning you. <b>This is not a joke</b>. Do not
								try to be funny and test it out I&nbsp;will ban you.</div>
						</div>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question">
					<h3>He has to be joking, they won't ban people for THAT</h3>
					<p>I don't think he is, but there is only one way to find out for sure :thonk:</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question">
					<h3>Why would they actually do that</h3>
					<p>I think it's like... A troll trap, because only brainless people who don't care about the mods and the server would
						DM the bot knowing it would get them banned...</p>
					<p>But we'll do it anyway! DM Akari today!!!</p>
					<p>Also apparently people did lewd things with the bot, so if you're gonna DM it, <b>be sure to be as lewd and disgusting as possible.</b></p>
				</div>

				<div class="question">
					<h3>What do I get for getting banned on purpose?</h3>
					<p><b>Nothing.</b></p>
				</div>

				<div class="question">
					<h3>What do I lose for getting banned on purpose?</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>The right to access a cool server</li>
						<li>Nice global emotes</li>
						<li>Akari's respect and love</li>
						<li>Your SWAG</li>
						<li>The ability to DM Akari again</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="question">
					<h3>Wait, so why would I DM that bot?</h3>
					<p>/shrug</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question">
					<h3>Can I DM Nao instead? <small>(The&nbsp;owner)</small></h3>
					<p>That can work too if you're annoying enough</p>

			<h1>About us</h1>

			<div class="two-columns">
				<div>
					<h4>What we are</h4>
					<p>We are the <b>AkariDM Foundation</b>, we are a non-profit corporation, our goal is to spread the word about how important
						it is to DM Akari and <b>get banned from Chiaki Fan Club</b>.</p>

					<h4>Our Mission</h4>
					<p>Our mission is to make it so as many people as possible get banned for DMing Akari, we don't have any specific goal,
						we believe we must focus on the present, and the future is irrelevant to us.</p>
					<p>However, we still want to become a charity as big and important as the <b>Red Cross</b>, because they may
						save lives, but <b>we get people banned</b>, we're the one who diserve all your money because <b>we are behind a more important
						cause</b>.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h4>What we do</h4>
					<p>We encourage and recommend everyone to get banned for no reason, we try to convince people to do so in as many ways
						as possible, like door-to-door talk, informational website, educational videos... <b>Kinda like a religion!</b></p>

					<h4>Who we are</h4>
					<p>idk, mainly shitposters. kek</p>

					<h4>How we will change the world</h4>
					<p>We want to start a big movement, a digital suicide movement! Just like the <b>ALS Ice Bucket Challenge</b>, but bigger
						and better!<br> Let us all ban ourselves! <b>DM Akari Today!</b></p>
					<!-- MAN I SURE DO LOVE <b>MAKING RANDOM PARTS OF SENTENCES BOLD FOR NO REASON</b> -->
